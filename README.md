#Etch-a-Sketch

Build Etch-a-Sketch using only vanilla Javascript and the DOM. All done in HTML, within the "script" tags, except 2 style elements in the "head" tag, for validation reasons not possible through the DOM. Default sketch area is a 16X16 square grid. Click "custom board" button to reveal input to change amount of squares. Creation of custom board also randomizes the square colors every time the mouse passes over.
